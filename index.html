        <p>
          Late Beatrice Ngozi Nwokomah, formally known as Mrs. Beatrice Ngozi Nwokomah-Ohaeri, was born on July 23, 1958,
          into the family of the late Mr. Joseph Aliukwu Nwokomah of the Umu-ebe family, Edihuru kindred in Obigbor community,
          and the late Mrs. Virginia Nwokomah (née Okwu) of the Umu Okpoko family, Uriem kindred of Obagi—all within the Egi clan
          of Ogba-Egbema-Ndoni Local Government Area of Rivers State, Nigeria. 
        </p>

        <p>
          She was one of four children, including her beloved brother, the late Pastor Simon Nonye Nwokomah.
          Fondly called “Beaty” by those close to her, she lost her other two siblings in early childhood.
          As the only surviving children, Beaty and her brother shared a deep and enduring bond.
          Pastor Nonye cherished his sister dearly—a love often expressed in the heartfelt letters he wrote to her,
          especially one penned when he first arrived in Lagos State at the start of his political career in 1980.
          This bond had been nurtured based on a solemn instruction from their father before his untimely passing,
          due to an undiagnosed illness, when Beaty was just 16. He had asked Nonye to always look after his sister.
          Pastor Nonye honored this promise faithfully throughout his life. 
        </p>

          Her early years were marked by resilience and determination. Although her primary education at State Primary School, Obuburu, 
          was disrupted by the Nigerian Civil War, she returned to complete it and earned her First School Leaving Certificate in 1974. 
        </p>

        <p>
          She began her secondary education at Community Girls Secondary School, Rumuji, before moving on to Government Secondary School, 
          Umuagbai Obigbo (now Oyigbo). This is where she met her first love and high school sweetheart, Pastor Nduka Lawarence Ohaeri. Due to personal and political challenges, she was unable to secure           her senior school certificate at the time. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Beatrice’s academic journey was deeply impacted by national instability. She had earned a scholarship to study in Australia, but this 
          opportunity was cut short following the military coup led by General Muhammadu Buhari. Her brother, Nonye Nwokomah—then principal private 
          secretary to the Minister of Works and later Finance, Dr. Victor Masi—was imprisoned for five years for refusing to betray his boss. 
          This deeply affected Beatrice emotionally and altered the course of her life. Despite these setbacks, she persevered. 
          In 2003, she obtained her long-delayed SSCE from Immaculate Comprehensive College. Her passion for education and desire to impact the 
          next generation led her to the National Teachers’ Institute in Kaduna (Ahoada branch), where she earned her Nigeria Certificate in Education (NCE) in 2007.

          Mrs. Nwokomah-Ohaeri was an industrious woman with an entrepreneurial spirit. Her love for elegance and fashion inspired her to train as a fashion designer, 
          a skill she mastered with diligence. After completing her apprenticeship and serving under her mentor, she was certified as a fashion designer. 
          She went on to establish Onyechiugo Fashion Designing Centre, which was officially registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission in 1997.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2003, she became a major supplier for Courdeau Catering Services through her active involvement with the Umu-Ikoro Youths Association, Obagi. 
          In 2006, she transitioned into education, joining Cambridge Paradise Universal School, Omoku, Rivers State, as a classroom teacher in the nursery and 
          primary section. Her loyalty and dedication soon earned her the roles of School Administrator and Matron—positions she held with integrity and grace.

        <p>
          Late Mrs. Beatrice Ngozi Nwokomah-Ohaeri was a resilient woman of faith and devotion. Born into a Sabbath-observing Christian family, The Church of God (Seventh Day) 
          (Madu bu Ajaah), she was raised by her late parents, Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Aliukwu Nwokomah, in the way of the Lord. In the 1980s, she moved from her hometown Obigbor to Omoku 
          to learn fashion design. There, she joined the Church of God (Seventh Day), World Headquarters Jerusalem Israel, and was baptized by Pastor Benjamin Igwe during the 
          Last Supper program in Egbeda. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Her commitment to Christ was profound. She served as Secretary of the Omoku District Women’s Association under Pastor Benjamin Igwe and later Pastor Clinton N. Ake, 
          before becoming a Church Mother. Gifted with a beautiful voice, she led foundational songs during Sabbath services, leaving a lasting impact wherever she worshipped. 
          Her love for prayer was infectious. She gathered young mothers and others weekly for prayer and spiritual growth. Every Thursday, she visited orphanages to pray with 
          and support the children—an extension of her vision to serve widows, orphans, and the downtrodden. Her motto to all who encountered her was: “Always pray and have a sound foundation.” 
          She lived the scripture: “Let your Yes be Yes, and your No, No.” <br>

          Despite marital struggles, she raised four responsible children and was their spiritual guide. 
        </p>
